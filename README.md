# Otis

The `Otis` project is a REST API service designed to store various data about players in a database.  
It is built on the Micronaut framework, which facilitates the development of such services.

This approach minimizes the need for requests to third-party services and enables internal services to work with players
who are offline.

> **âš  CAUTION**  
> If a player is not registered on the server, a call to a third-party service is necessary.  
> Currently, this project does not provide functionality to handle such cases.

## Interaction

Plugins, extensions, or services from our ecosystem communicate with the `Otis` service via web requests.  
While this may seem unconventional in a plugin, REST API calls offer greater flexibility because they eliminate the need
for an active connection to a database server.

It is the responsibility of the use case to handle scenarios where the service is unreachable.
